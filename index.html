        <h3 class="paragraph-header">Who am I?</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          I am Andrew Williams, an aspiring Full-Stack Web Developer who has been programming in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (specifically using Node.js) for a couple of months.
          Before learning the previously mentioned programming languages, I had been programming in Python for 3+ years. Those 3 years consisted of many
          personal projects such as webscraping websites such as Zillow to find average house prices in certain areas using BeautifulSoup4 then changing to API 
          requests, collecting cryptocurrency price in realtime using websockets, and data analysis using Numpy and Pandas. After realizing that Python is currently 
          mostly used for data collection and analysis, I decided that I would be better off doing something that I enjoy more: creating the front-end and
          back-end for websites.
        </p>
        <h3 class="paragraph-header">Why am I interested in programming?</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          I have an unhealthy desire to learn as much as I possibly can in relation to programming whether that be creating websites, api, apps, you name it. I would 
          love to get much more familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Even though I have been programming for the better part of 4 years now, I'm still having 
          trouble wrapping my head around the professional workflow and I think having professional assignments with a team to collaborate with will definitely help 
          me to become a better programmer.
        </p>
        <h3 class="paragraph-header">Do I atleast have some professional experience or education?</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          I do not have any intention in hiding it, I have neither relevant education nor relevant experience. I can't say that I am a big fan of going to some 
          university where they're going to charge me around $40,000 in unrelated credits towards my degree with money that I do not have. Unfortunately, my ideology towards forwarding my education is precisely
          why I do not have professional experience, go figure. Despite school being somewhat of miserable money dump, I would like to pursue a Bachelor's Degree in 
          Computer Science after I can get myself my first developer job so atleast I'd be able to live on my own and pay for school without pulling out a loan
          (I hate owing people money, especially banks or the government).
        </p>
        <h3 class="paragraph-header">Why am I here if I don't have relevant experience or education?</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          I may not have a piece of paper that can immediately prove that I am as competent as the others but I do have something that will prove that I am as competent 
          as a programmer with a degree, my extraordinary ability to adapt and learn on the fly. Take this website that you're on as an example, I don't really have much
          of an idea of what I'm doing. I understand that hiring me can be seen as a huge risk but please understand that I'm willing to take a lower salary than a programmer with
          a degree until I can prove myself to be a valuable asset. By lower salary I'm talking ~$30,000 - $60,000.
